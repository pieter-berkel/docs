## Goals

My primary goal is to maintain consistency across all my projects by documenting my opinionated approaches to:

- **Next.js development** - My preferred patterns, configurations, and workflows
- **Future frameworks** - As I explore and adopt new technologies, I'll document my learnings here

This documentation serves as both a reference for my own work and a way to share my development philosophy with others who might find these approaches useful.

## Why Opinionated?

Every developer eventually develops their own preferences for tooling, project structure, and workflows. Rather than reinventing the wheel for each project, I'm consolidating my battle-tested approaches in one place to:

- Maintain consistency across projects
- Speed up project setup and development
- Share knowledge with team members and the community
- Continuously refine and improve my processes

Feel free to explore the documentation and adapt any patterns that might be useful for your own projects!
