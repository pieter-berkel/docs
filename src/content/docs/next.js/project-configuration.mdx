description: How to configure a new Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and more.
---

When starting a new Next.js project, a solid configuration is key for a smooth development experience. This guide walks you through setting up a project with a standard and opinionated set of tools.

## Initial Project Setup

To create a new Next.js app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest
```

You will be prompted with a series of questions. For this project's configuration, answer them as follows:

- **What is your project named?** › `my-app`
- **Would you like to use TypeScript?** › **Yes**
- **Would you like to use ESLint?** › **Yes**
- **Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?** › **Yes**
- **Would you like to use `src/` directory?** › **No**
- **Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)** › **Yes**
- **Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/\*)?** › **No**

This setup gives you a project with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, the App Router, and the default `@/` import alias, without a `src` directory.

## Tools

### TypeScript

To optimize your Next.js project for modern JavaScript and TypeScript, update your `tsconfig.json` file with the following configuration:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "incremental": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "noEmit": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "target": "es2022",
    "plugins": [{ "name": "next" }],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

This configuration ensures cleaner code, smaller bundle output, and better runtime performance while enforcing stricter TypeScript rules.

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.

1.  Install Prettier as a dev dependency:

    ```bash
    pnpm add -D prettier
    ```

2.  Add a `format` script to your `package.json`:

    ```json title="package.json"
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint",
        "format": "prettier --write ."
      }
    }
    ```

3.  To enable format-on-save in VS Code, create a `.vscode/settings.json` file and add the following:
    ```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
    {
      "editor.formatOnSave": true,
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    }
    ```
    This requires the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension to be installed in VS Code.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.example` and a `.env` file in the root of your project. The `.env` file should contain your environment variables, while the `.env.example` file should list the variables without values, serving as a template for others to follow.

Your `.env` file is ignored by Git, so you can safely store secrets in it.

```env title=".env.example"
# Example environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
```

```env title=".env"
# Example environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

## Shadcn UI

[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. It also helps establish a robust design system for your project by altering your stylesheet, TailwindCSS configuration, and setting good default CSS variables.

To get started, run the `init` command:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

This will guide you through a few questions to configure `components.json` for your project and set up the design system.
