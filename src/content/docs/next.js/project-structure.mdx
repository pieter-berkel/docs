This guide outlines an opinionated approach to structuring Next.js projects using the app router. It focuses on colocation and naming conventions to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Directory Consistency

To maintain consistency across projects, the directories inside the app router or features folder are always standardized. These directories include:

- **components**: Reusable React components
- **hooks**: Custom React hooks
- **actions**: Server actions
- **validations**: Validation logic
- **utils**: Utility functions
- **lib**: Shared libraries
- **assets**: Static assets

By adhering to this structure, projects remain organized and predictable, making them easier to navigate and scale.

## Why This Structure?

- **Colocation**: Files are grouped by functionality, making it easier to navigate the codebase.
- **Consistency**: Naming conventions ensure uniformity across the project.
- **Scalability**: The structure scales well as the project grows.

By following this structure, you can maintain a clean and organized Next.js project that is easy to work with and extend.

## Colocation Philosophy

The core philosophy is to keep files as close as possible to where they are used, except when they are shared across multiple parts of the project. In the Next.js app router, this means colocating files next to the route they are used in.

## Example Project Structure

```
app/
  todo/
    create/
      page.tsx
      _actions/
        create-todo-action.ts
      _validations/
        create-todo-validation.ts
  user/
    profile/
      page.tsx
      _actions/
        update-profile-action.ts
      _validations/
        update-profile-validation.ts
  _utils/
    format-date.ts
    generate-id.ts
  _hooks/
    use-fetch.ts
    use-auth.ts
```

## Handling Shared Files

When a file, such as an action or validation, is used across multiple locations in the project, it should be moved to a `features` folder. This ensures shared functionality is centralized while maintaining clarity.

## Example for Shared Files

```
features/
  todo/
    actions/
      create-todo-action.ts
    validations/
      create-todo-validation.ts
```
